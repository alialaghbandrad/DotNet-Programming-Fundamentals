FINAL INSTRUCTIONS
==================

Create project "FinalFlights" WPF with DotNet Framework type

Implement functionality as shown in the picture.

Additional notes:
* To implement "File->Save Selected" menu option use File Chooser to allow user to choose file to save to. ListView/GridView allows multiple selection.
* Main window must be resizable (using DockPanel) despite of how it looks in the illustration.
* ListView with GridView must be used to show ALL columns of Flights. You do NOT need to implement ToString() despite it being mentioned in the picture.
* Only one item is deleted at a time.
* Dialog window should be called AddEditDialog
* Date must be shown using Date Picker in AddEditDialog (ignore the format in the picture).
* Ignore 'Id' both in the dialog and class Flight. Also there is NO MS SQL database.
* Text "Save" button in AddEditDialog must be changed to "Add" when adding, "Update" when updating.
* To edit an item user double-clicks on it and this displays AddEditDialog.
* Data must be saved just before program exits to @"..\..\flights.txt" file using SaveDataToFile method.
* Data must be loaded when program starts from the same file (if it exists) using LoadDataFromFile method.

What to submit:
* Close Visual Studio
* Create ZIP file of Project's directory (ONLY ZIP, no others)
* Upload ZIP file to LEA.
